In this cycle, they drift through an important region,

Sea salt, carried by winds over the oceans, forms spirals during storms like Hurricane Irma, while Saharan dust is drawn out by rain. Advances in computing help scientists create more detailed simulations, showing how aerosols interact with storm systems and improving weather predictions. A unique example is Hurricane Ophelia, which carried dust from the Sahara and smoke from Portugal all the way to Ireland and the UK, a rare event that highlights the complex interactions between aerosols and weather",
